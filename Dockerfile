# next we'll add java to our image.. unfortunately, Oracle prevents their Java distributions
# from being included into a Docker image due to a provision in their license that the 
# license agreement much be manually accepted by a human when the JDK is downloaded.
# So, instead I've built custom OpenJDK builds for both JDK7 and JDK8 from the current 
# OpenJDK Mercurial branches. I did this because it's always a box of chocolates when
# you take other random OpenJDK builds from apt repos/the web -- so with these I know exactly
# what they were built off of and I have confidence that C* will run cleanly with these builds.
 
# upgrade dtests still run C* 2.0 which needs JDK7, so yes, we need a JDK7 build still
